   The application should be available to access publicly (Refer security groups inbound/outbound rules).

5. Set up slave for the jenkins instance(master) by spinning up anohter instance.

8. Create an account in sonarcloud.io
9. Integrate sonarqube cloud with jenkins and modify the existing pipeline to have static code test steps added.
