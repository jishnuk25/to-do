Project: Create a CI/CD pipeline for a web application on AWS using Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins.

Requirements:

A web application (can be a simple web app or a sample app)
Docker containerization of the web application
A Kubernetes cluster to deploy the containerized app
A Jenkins server to build and deploy the application
AWS infrastructure to host the Kubernetes cluster and Jenkins server

Steps:

Create a Dockerfile for the web application and build a Docker image of the application.
Push the Docker image to a Docker registry (Docker Hub or AWS ECR).
Create an AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like CloudFormation or Terraform. This infrastructure should include the following:
A Kubernetes cluster to deploy the containerized app.
A Jenkins server to build and deploy the application.
An AWS RDS database to store the application data.
Install and configure Jenkins plugins for Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS integration.
Create a Jenkins pipeline that automates the following tasks:
Pull the code from the code repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
Build a Docker image of the application.
Push the Docker image to the Docker registry.
Deploy the Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster.
Run integration tests and store the test results.
Promote the Docker image to production if the tests pass.
Set up monitoring and logging for the application using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
Implement security measures like SSL encryption, firewall rules, and user authentication.
By completing this project, you'll be able to apply your skills in containerization, automation, infrastructure management, and monitoring to create a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a web application on AWS.
